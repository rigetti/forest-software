## Development Tools

[pyQuil](http://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil) - [Python] The core development library for working with Forest 
and Quil on QVMs and QPUs.

[jsquil](https://github.com/mapmeld/jsquil) - [JavaScript] A Javascript wrapper for the Forest API.

## Integrations

[forestopenfermion](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/forestopenfermion) - [Python] A library for interfacing 
Forest with [OpenFermion](http://openfermion.org/), a Python library for quantum simulations on quantum computers.

## Simulators

[reference-qvm](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/reference-qvm) - [Python] A lightweight implementation 
of a quantum virtual machine.

[oqaml](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/oqaml) - [OCaml] Another lightweight quantum virutal machine implementation.

## Algorithm Libraries

[grove](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/grove) - [Python] A core algorithm and application library with examples of quantum algorithms including the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.
